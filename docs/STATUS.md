# Implementation status — 2026-09-18

Source version is 0.6.0, unreleased and classified beta. Baseline 0.5.0 was
validated and committed as `1aaa747`. The complete v0.6–v1.0 roadmap has not
been delivered or validated by this slice.

## Implemented

- Shared analysis context with legacy analyzer compatibility; additional
  spatial-image, JPEG structure, GIF, WAV and text signals.
- Recursive CTF service, bounded decoder/archive candidates, artifact hashes
  and provenance, CLI, API jobs/SSE/cancel/download and guided TUI.
- Additive JSON v2, HTML, SARIF and portable evidence bundles.
- Explicit signed-model catalog installation and research train/calibrate/
  export commands; lineage-aware manifests and benchmark metrics/gates.
- Full-image upstream tool installation with checksummed Stegseek, zsteg and
  dependencies, and OpenStego; Debian package licenses recorded.
- Research partitioning with reserved-pilot exclusions, connected lineage/
  camera/device groups, explicit held-out sources and exclusive output creation.
- AI triage cannot change primary scores/findings or act as detector coverage.
  See `DEVELOPMENT_DATA.md` for next-experiment prerequisites and limitations.
- Manifest-bound, bounded PNG/BMP feature extraction for train/validation;
  training input validation rejects unbound NPZ and non-train or altered rows.
  The initial spatial-summary features are experimental, not a validated detector.

## Verification

- Local checks use the provisioned `venv/bin/python` environment. The host's
  system Python has an older cryptography package without Argon2id and cannot
  collect the full suite; activate the environment before running check commands.
- Python 3.11: 199 tests pass; total coverage 91.91%. Decoupled statistical
  categories, calibrated SPA/RS detectors, and natural synthetic detection tests
  pass; these tests are regression evidence, not accuracy evidence.
- Ruff and mypy (69 source files) pass; diff whitespace checks pass.
- PyTorch, ONNX, and ONNX Runtime are provisioned in the research environment.
  CPU optimizer execution, determinism/repeatability, nonfinite loss guards, and
  ONNX export parity against onnxruntime were verified end-to-end.
- Version 0.6.0 wheel and sdist build successfully; the wheel contains no models.
- Web: one test passes; TypeScript/Vite build passes.
- Full Docker build and non-root/read-only/network-disabled smoke have passed
  for native payload and independently generated Steghide and OpenStego exact recovery.
  `scripts/docker-ctf-smoke.py` reproduces these limited integration checks.
  OpenStego's writable-preferences initialization was fixed; tool completion
  alone is not evidence of a hidden payload or successful extraction.
- Python 3.12–3.14 are configured in CI but were not executed locally.

## Open acceptance gates and limitations

- BOSSbase single-source pilot: 1,000 covers + 1,000 independently embedded
  stegos, all stegos verified through upstream extraction. Base detection
  failed: recall 0% at threshold 70, ROC-AUC 0.499021. Controlled CTF recovery
  passed 30/30, including known-password image cases and simple decoders.
  See `PILOT_RESULTS.md`; these are different capabilities, not overall accuracy.
- ALASKA2/StegoAppDB and cross-source evaluation remain **unavailable**.
  No support cell has demonstrated the requested cross-source accuracy gates.
- Blind 120-challenge recovery, top-three recommendations and latency: **unavailable**.
  The smoke examples are not evidence of 90% CTF recovery.
- Published, trained spatial/JPEG model packs: absent; model catalog is empty.
  Training/export plumbing is not an independently evaluated detector.
- Spatial RS/sample-pair/weighted signals are approximations. Full calibrated
  algorithms and JPEG recompression/family discrimination remain research work.
- New CTF code has not yet reached the 95% coverage target across every new file.
- Per-tool OS filesystem isolation, hard native-stage deadlines, exhaustive
  fuzzing and archive-bomb/process-escape gates are incomplete. A subprocess
  working directory does not restrict its filesystem permissions.
- Debian and Python transitive dependencies are not fully locked. Installation
  of every executable does not demonstrate successful recovery with every tool.
- CTF API jobs are process-local; durable restart/resume and a full live-output
  workflow need additional work.

Use the current release as a local exploratory/CTF assistant. Validate findings
with independent tools. Statistical scores are heuristic and uncalibrated;
they are not probabilities or forensic proof.
