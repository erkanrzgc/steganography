# Project memory

This file is the provider-independent handoff contract for maintainers and
automation working on this repository. Read it before changing code.

## Architecture boundaries

- `core/` owns reusable application services and immutable domain types.
- `modules/` contains carrier/analyzer plug-ins. Third-party analyzers using the
  existing `Analyzer.analyze(Path)` contract must continue to work.
- CLI, API, TUI, and reports call the shared service layer; they do not contain
  independent detection or extraction logic.
- Untrusted files, archives, decoder output, and external-tool output are always
  bounded. Never execute an extracted artifact or follow an artifact symlink.
- Optional AI is explanation/triage only. It must not affect primary verdicts,
  calibration, or benchmark gates.
- The base wheel remains model-free and does not require external executables.
  Model and dataset downloads require an explicit user command.

## Compatibility rules

- Preserve payload v2/v3 extraction and the public `Carrier`/`Analyzer` plug-in
  contracts.
- Preserve existing `/v1` and `/v2` routes. New report fields are additive.
- `confirmed` requires a verified project marker or successful extraction.
- Missing required coverage produces `inconclusive`, never a clean verdict.
- Reports never contain absolute host paths, passwords, steg keys, environment
  secrets, or an unredacted secret-bearing command.
- Do not write project memory beneath `.codex`, `.agents`, `.claude`, or another
  provider-specific directory.

## Verification

Run from the repository root using a fully provisioned environment:

```text
ruff check .
mypy core modules report api steganography ui registry.py config.py cli.py
pytest
```

The PR gate is Python 3.11–3.14 and total coverage >= 90%; new analysis, CTF,
and report code targets >= 95%. Real-dataset jobs may be skipped only as
`skipped`/`unavailable`, never passed.

## Active milestone

`v0.6`: shared analysis context, PNG/BMP native analysis, bounded CTF playbook,
portable JSON/HTML/SARIF/bundle reporting, and initial CLI/API/TUI surfaces.
See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for current status and later milestones.

## Handoff checklist

1. Preserve unrelated working-tree changes and avoid history rewrites.
2. Update architecture, roadmap/status, benchmark protocol, and changelog when
   a slice changes their contract.
3. Add independent fixtures and adversarial limit/security tests.
4. Record optional dependency/tool absence as coverage, not success.
5. Run focused tests, the full suite, lint, type checking, and `git diff --check`.
6. Keep commits small and state any unverified environment-dependent checks.
